May be seen as No SQL Database; MongoDB is an example of this.

### No SQL Breakdown
* This db allows you to build an application without needing to define a schema first. You can just define it as you go. 
* It offers a greater flexibility with how to store your data, you may be starting a project without a clear connection between data or there may be a lot of unstructured data. 


### MongoDB
* Document oriented, which means it stores information as documents. 

An example of this, is each user being its own document and if you need to grab a specific user you will be directed to a specific document which contains their data. 

A LinkedIn profile might be an example of a NoSQL database. Mongo has its own query language which allows us (the backend) to communicate with the db.
