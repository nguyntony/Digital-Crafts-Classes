# In your own words, write an answer to the following questions:

## What is the difference between git and GitHub?

-   Git is more local and personal where you are able to create/modify content that you are in control of. This is on your local machine.

-   Github seems to be the next step where you take your content and you are able to share it with your community, it uses a browser along with GUI so that others may manuever through your programs or even copy them.

## What is the difference between front-end and backend development?

-   Front-end deals mainly with the overall design and aesthetic of your program, it may include user functionality, styling, etc.

-   Back-end deals with the "setup" such as making a server and hosting information but also gathering and manipulating data.
