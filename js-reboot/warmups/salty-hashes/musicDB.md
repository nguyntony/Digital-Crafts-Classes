If you were to build a music database, you might have the following tables:

-   Artists
-   Albums
-   Songs
-   Genres

Describe how these tables relate to each other. Use the following terminology:

-   "has one"
-   "has many"
-   "belongs to"

For example: "An Artist has many Albums"

**Artist** has many **Ablums**
**Albums** has many **Songs**
**Songs** has one **Genre** (?, idk music)
**Songs** belongs to **Albums** and **Artists** and **Genres**
**Artist** has many **Genres**
