The html page is sending a post request, it will have a route declared in the html and on our express side, we will match that route. And you will get that by doing app.post(). Something neat that you can do is after the user submits the form, express is able to return (or forward) another page. 

For example: A user submits their payment information to purchase something, after they submit it, you can redirect or forward another page with an invoice or order details.
