# Fetch
- - - -
To understand how fetch works, I am using a [Rick & Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/) to use alongside with express in order to display data to a webpage. 

### Installation
Node does not have fetch readily available for you to use, you need to install the node-fetch module and require it in your project in order to user fetch.
* `npm i node-fetch`
* `const fetch = require("node-fetch")`


### Using fetch
With fetch, the first argument that you pass is the url. There is some more advance stuff that fetch can do when you pass a second argument which would be an object and you can set a method type. But for this exercise, I did not do that (something to explore in the future) 

```js
fetch("url-link-path")
	.then(res => res.json())
	.then(data => console.log(data))
```

Fetch returns a promise and in this case it is a response object, because it is a promise we can use .then(). Note how that I am using .json() because the API returns json data which isnâ€™t readable by the browser, we need to use .json() in order for it to transform to something that is readable. After that I then chain the res object to another .then() which will now reference that object as data.
