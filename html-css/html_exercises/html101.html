<p>This exercise is about making lists</p>
<p>Here's what I like about lists:</p>
<ul>
    <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
    <li>That's about it</li>
    <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
</ul>
<p>When you make a list, do it in this order:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
    <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag
    </li>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Use li tags nested in the list for your list items.
        </li>
        <ol>
            <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
        </ol>
