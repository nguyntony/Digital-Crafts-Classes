            Hi, everyone! <br>
            Welcome to my blog! I have finished about two weeks of the DigitalCrafts bootcamp and it's going really
            well.
            This past Friday, we present our python game projects. My game was based on the Avatar the Last Airbender
            story,
            so my game is a story RPG!
        </p>
        <p class="post-1">The player of my game will be the Avatar and will have to go through four challenges
            to
            learn skills. These skills are important in defeating the evil Fire Lord! <br>
            Here is a sneak peek of the challenges:
        <ol>
            <li>A riddle</li>
            <li>A memorization game</li>
            <li>A pattern guesser</li>
            <li>Rock, paper, scissor</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
