const mult = num => num * num
// we are const a variable and it is accepting only one parameter which is num so we don't need the () and we use the => and then here, we are updating the num value by multipling it by itself using the *, and this is an implicit return which is why if you have the function equal to a variable we then can console.log the variable and it will return the answer.

let answer = mult(10)
console.log(answer)
