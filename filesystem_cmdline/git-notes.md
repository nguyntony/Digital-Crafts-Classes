# Notes on Git

## how to commit 
```
1. you make a directory in the terminal 
2. you git init the directory that you want to use.
3. git add .
4. git status 
5. git commit -m "comment"
6. git push origin 
7. everytime you would like to update/change something, repeat steps 3-6.
```

## how to git init
```
1. open the terminal and go ahead and mkdir wherever you want.
2. go to that dir and then run git init
3. go to github, create a new repo and name it whatever.
4. IMPORTANT, do not create a .md file
5. after you create this in github you will be taken to another website.
6. copy and run the command that is on the website that has:
git remote add origin ... 
7. copy and run the command git push -u origin master. 

- happens from inside of the folder 
```

## another way of doing the above (cloning)
```
1. you can create a repo first
2. you will copy the http under the green code button on the github repo
3. go to your terminal
4. go to the directory that you wish to have your repo.
5. git clone {paste that http link}
6. this will create a dir with the name of the repo

- you clone into the parent folder
```
